                            Meeting new people is wonderful, but you should always be cautious when engaging with strangers. Whether you're exchanging initial messages or meeting in person, use your best judgment and prioritize your safety. While you cannot control the actions of
                            others, there are steps you can take to ensure your safety during your IDo experience.

                            Never send money, especially over wire transfer, even if the person claims to be in an emergency. Wiring money is like sending cash — it’s nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace where the money went. Never share information that could be
                            used to access your financial accounts. If another user asks you for money, report it to us immediately.

                            you share about your children on your profile and in early communications. Avoid sharing details such as your children’s names, where they go to school, or their ages or genders.

                            Keep your conversations on the IDo platform while you get to know your match. Because exchanges on IDo are subject to our Safe Message Filters (learn more here), users with bad intentions often try to move the conversation to text, messaging apps, email,

                            Watch out for scammers who claim to be from your country but stuck somewhere else, especially if they ask for financial help to return home. Be wary of anyone who will not meet in person or talk on a phone/video call—they may not be who they say they
                            are. If someone is avoiding your questions or pushing for a serious relationship without meeting or getting to know you first — that’s a red flag.

                            Be careful while traveling. We recognize and believe in the importance of being inclusive of all gender identities and sexual orientations, but the reality is this: nowhere in the world is without potential risk, and some countries have specific laws
                            that target LGBTQ+ people. Check out the laws around you when you travel to a new place and research what types of legal protection, if any, are available to you based on sexual orientation. In the event that you’re in unsafe
                            territory, we suggest disabling your IDo account or going Incognito. It’s important to exercise extra caution if you choose to connect with new people in these countries - as some law enforcements have been known to use dating
                            apps as tools for potential entrapment. Some countries have also recently introduced laws that criminalize communications between individuals on same-sex dating applications or websites and even aggravate penalties if that
                            communication leads to sexual encounters.

                            When used correctly and consistently, condoms can significantly reduce the risk of contracting and passing on STI’s like HIV. But, be aware of STIs like herpes or HPV that can be passed on through skin-to-skin contact. The risk of contracting some STIs
                            can be reduced through vaccination.

                            All sexual activity must start with consent and should include ongoing check-ins with your partner. Verbal communication can help you and your partner ensure that you respect each other’s boundaries. Consent can be withdrawn at any time, and sex is never
                            owed to anyone. Do not proceed if your partner seems uncomfortable or unsure, or if your partner is unable to consent due to the effects of drugs or alcohol. Read more about it here.
