                            This Privacy Policy explains the information that IDo Application (“IDo”) collects about users of the IDo mobile application and related website www.ido.com, how we use that information, and with whom we share it. If we make any material changes to our
                            privacy policy, we will post a revised Privacy Policy on www.ido.com/privacy and on the privacy policy page within IDo. Changes to the Privacy Policy become effective the day they are posted on www.ido.com and/or posted within
                            IDo, and that will constitute notification to users. Updates and changes may be made to the privacy policy when new versions of the app are released (i.e., IDo 0.0.1 etc.) If you have any questions, please contact us by sending
